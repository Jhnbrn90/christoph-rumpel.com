<h2>Explicit Code</h2>

<p>This might be an easy tip, but giving good explicit names to variables and methods will improve your code a lot. But
    then developers also say <code>naming</code> is one of the hardest things in programming. ü§∑‚Äç</p>

<h3>Example #1</h3>

<x-code-tab code-name="explicit-code-example-1"></x-code-tab>

<h3>Example #2</h3>

<x-code-tab code-name="explicit-code-example-2"></x-code-tab>

<h2>Early Returns</h2>

<p>The concept of <code>early returns</code> refers to a practice where we try to void nesting by
    breaking a structure down to specific actions. In return we will get a more linear code which is
    much easier to grasp. Every case is separated and good to read by itself. Don't be afraid of using
    multiple return statements.</p>

<h3>Example #1</h3>
<x-code-tab code-name="early-return-example-1"></x-code-tab>

<h3>Example #2</h3>
<x-code-tab code-name="early-return-example-2"></x-code-tab>
