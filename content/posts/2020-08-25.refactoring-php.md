title: Refactoring PHP
categories: PHP
summary: I've been programming in PHP now for almost 10 years and if there is one thing I learned over this period, it's that readability is the key for maintainable and sustainable code. This is why I see refactoring as one of my main skills today. In this post, I share with you my refactoring practices for PHP.

## Early Returns

- avoind else makes it less compley and better to read because it is clear what "else" is

```php
public function calculateScore(User $user): int
    {
        if ($user->inactive) {
            $score = 0;
        } else {
            if ($user->hasBonus) {
                $score = $user->score + $this->bonus;
            } else {
                $score = $user->score;
            }
        }

        return $score;
    }
```

```php
public function calculateScore(User $user): int
{
    if ($user->inactive) {
        return 0;
    }

    if ($user->hasBonus) {
        return $user->score + $this->bonus;
    }

    return $user->score;
}
```

## Explicit Code

## Use Collections

## Naming
